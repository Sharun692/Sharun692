Hello There! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sharun, An Aerospace Engineer turned tech enthusiast.

Think of me as a mad scientist, but with better hair. I love building stuff, breaking stuff, and then building it back up again (usually). 

Now, Iâ€™m a Research Engineer at Advanced Robotics Center & MathEXLab at NUS, turning science fiction into reality. When Iâ€™m not wrangling robots or diving into fluid dynamics, you can find me tinkering with code or plotting world domination (just kidding... maybe).

I'm diving deep into soft robotics, fluid dynamics, AI/ML and Deep Web. 

Let's create something awesome together. ;)
